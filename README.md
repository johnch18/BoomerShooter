# BoomerShooter
A mod to implement boomer shooter mechanics

## Games Targeted:

Any franchise made before half-life is fair game, but here are the ones I'm looking at right now:
- DOOM I/II
- Quake I/II (haven't played later entries but we'll see)
- Duke Nukem 3D

One thing to note is that if guns are too similar, I will either combine them together or only implement one.
Melee is also fair game.
